    <h1>ENHYPEN Albums | Songs | Lore</h1>

    <p class="enhypen-desc">
    Through the curse of blood, through vampire nights, through memory, confessions, and risksâ€”
    the lore becomes a story of not just darkness, but of longing, choice, and transformation.
    These vampires are not passive victims; they fight for love, and for a future beyond fate.
    Like the joke in the fandom, they are yearners.

        </tr>

            <tr>
        <td><b>BORDER: DAY ONE</b></td>
        <td>Their story begins with the border, a symbol for the boundary between what was and what will be: between the known past and unknown future. In this album, the seven boys find themselves at the threshold. They have just survived I-Land, a trial of competition and growth, and will not be facing the first day of "crossing that border" into their new lives. Visually and thematically, the albums uses dual concepts of dawk and dusk--light and dark, beginnings and endings.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. Intro: Walk the Line</b> - This is the "intro" song of the album. It's like stepping out onto the border line itself. The narrator (often a member) speaks of walking a long line, questioning where the next step should be, and acknowledging uncertainty. It sets the stage for crossing boundaries.<br>
            <b>2. Given-Taken</b> - This is the title track of the album. A core conflict in the lore is, was their debut given to them, or did they take it? This duality s literalized in the lyrics ("Between giving and taking / It's time for my proving") and in the music video's imagery had chains, shadows, transformations, and fangs emerging. In the music video, we can see the members chained up, bleeding, in Victorian-esque settings, and gradually transforming--hinting that beings beyond human (vampiric) nature are entering their story.<br>
            <b>3. 10 Months</b> - This track suggests a reflection of the period of training/waiting/preparation before crossing the border. It grounds the supernatural metaphor in their real experience (i.e. how long they waited or endured)<br>
            <b>4. Flicker</b> - This track evokes glimpses, brief illuminations in darkness. In lore terms, moments of insight, doubt, or realization as they approach that border.<br>
            <b>5. Outro: Cross the Line</b> - This track closes the chapter, the closing happens. The border is traversed; they step into the unknown realm. This is the moment of transition from the "old world" into the realm where the rest of the lore will unfold.<br>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><b>BORDER: CARNIVAL</b></td>
        <td>Border: Carnival continues from Day One. Now that they have crossed the border, they enter a realm of spectacle, temptation, and chaos (the carnival.) This is a place where illusions and danger co-exist. In the carnival, the boys grapple with how to preserve their identity, feelings of being exposed, and the fear of getting lost in the dance of illusions. They still carry their vampiric metaphors forward--shadows, blood, werewolf imagery, external watchers.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. Drunk-Dazed</b> - This is the album's title track. It's the heart of the carnival--intoxication, disorientatio, being swept up in spectacle. The visuals include blood fountains, carnival-esque scenes, and juxtaposing light and dark. In the MV, shadowy figures resembling werewolves appear, and fans speculate on connections to past I-Land contestants like K and EJ as watchers of this carnival.<br>
            <b>2. Intro: The Invitation ; Outro: The Wormhole</b> - The invitation opens the carnival, while the wormhole hints at dimensional travel. This carnival is more than just a stage, it can lead to alternate realms. (The wormhole is used in some interpretations of transitions between album series).<br>
            <b>3. Mixed Up ; Not For Sale ; Fever</b> - These remaining tracks express the conflicting emotions of identity under scrutiny, the commodification (Not For Sale), and losing oneself (Mixed Up). The carnival is a place where they are both a spectacle and actors.<br>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><b>DIMENSION: DILEMMA</b></td>
        <td>With this album, the narrative expands. Beyond the carnival lies a multidimensional world, with new challenges, conflicting values, and inner turmoil. The boys find that crossing one border or surviving the carnival wasn't enough--new dimensions, paradoxes, and dilemmas await. Now, their "values begin to collide" and they are forced to recognize internal desires, identity conflicts, and the uncertainty of what to hold on to. They are in a realm where logic is fractured, and multiple selves or paths exist. They question what's real.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. Intro: Whiteout</b> - This signifies a blankness, a reset, an engulfing whiteness. The clean slate or unknown field where identity is undefined.<br>
            <b>2. Tamed-Dashed</b> - This is the album's title track. To be "tamed" versus to be "dashed" suggests conflict: control versus destruction. Their desires and wills clash.<br>
            <b>3. Upper Side Dreamin' ; Just a Little Bit ; Go Big or Go Home ; Blockbuster (feat. Yeonjun of TXT) ; Attention please! ; Interlude Question</b> - These remaining tracks map their internal struggle: ambitions, the urge for recognition, temptation, questioning of self, wanting but fearing. Each in this dimension is a tempation, a route. By the end, they haven't resolved fully, they are still in the dimension, still grappling and preparing for resolution or answer.<br>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><b>DIMENSION: ANSWER</b></td>
        <td>This album is the repackage of Dimension: Dilemma, and in the lore it functions as a continuation or resolution attempt. The "answer" suggests that in this chaotic dimensional realm, they seek to find what the right path is, what their identity should be, or how to unify conflicting selves. In some sense, this album is their attempt to answer the questions posed in Dilemma.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. Polaroid Love</b> - This is the only song in this album that is not in Dimension: Dilemma.<br>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><b>MANIFESTO: DAY 1</b></td>
        <td>This album marks a stage of agency. After experiencing borders, carnival, dimensions, dilemmas, and answers, the boys now declare they will take control. They are now longer passive travelers--they will voice their own truth, set their path, draw their future. This album is their statement: "We will pass the mic." (song in the album). They reject being shaped entirely by external forces.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. WALK THE  LINE</b> - Again, referencing the border or a line, but now more intentional: walking the line actively, asserting movement.<br>
            <b>2. Future Perfect (Pass the MIC)</b> - This is the album's title track. It suggests them taking control; "pass the mic" says they will speak and they will lead.<br>
            <b>3. ParadoXXX Invasion</b> - This is the invasion of paradoxes; the contradictions they faced invade their consciousness, and they must confront them.<br>
            <b>4. TFW (That Feeling When)</b> - This track talks about emotional vulnerabilities, how their feelings respond when identity clashes occur.<br>
            <b>5. SHOUT OUT</b> - A declaration to the world; calling out to others, and making themselves seen and heard.<br>
            <b>6. Foreshadow</b> - This hints future paths, that this is Day 1 of a new era; the future is uncertain but hopeful.<br>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><b>DARK BLOOD</b></td>
        <td>With this album, the lore fully leans into vampiric elements and darker themes: regret, sacrifice, eternal nightmares, connection through fate, and the price of love. The "blood" motif is central, both literal and metaphorical. This era often gets called the "vampire" era in fan discourse. The boys are no longer just metaphorical creatures, here they are vampire-beings with immortal attributes, existing in nocturnal, secret worlds.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. Fate</b> - This is the intro, again with member/s as narrators. This track opens the album like a heartbeat in the dark. The narrator speaks in fragments, almost like a prophecy or a memory being retold. Through whispers and echoes, "Fate" reminds them, and us, that this darkness is not random--it has been written. They were chosen for this eternal life, and the curse of love will come again. The track sets up the tragedy of the lore: beings bound by a fate they cannot undo.<br>
            <b>2. Bite Me</b> - This is the title track of the album. It's the centerpiece--the song where love and damnation collide. Lyrically, it's an invitation, a plea, and a surrender: "Just come kiss me and bite me." On the surface, it's a sensual metaphor for desire, but within the lore, it's the act that seals their bond. The bite is note merely physical, but a promise. It's how vampires share blood, love, and fate. In the music video, we see the members bound in white and black--purity and sin--watched by celestial symbols. The story shows that their bond with the girl (the mortal) is what awakens their curse. She carries the blood that can both save and destroy them, and when they choose her, their fangs return--their immortality reignited through forbidden love. This track captures the paradox of their existence: they crave touch but destroy what they touch; they long for warmth but are bound to the night. The choreography's mirrored movements reflect this duality.<br>
            <b>3. Sacrifice (Eat Me Up)</b> - If Bite Me is about the moment of surrender, Sacrifice is about the aftermath--the moment when love becomes an act of consumption. The song embodies hunger for love, freedom, and absolution. It explores the destructive nature of devotion--the kind where giving yourself to someone means losing yourself entirely. In the lore, this is the point where the boys realize that their connection, as beautiful as it is, cannot coexist with light. The more they love her, the more they lose their humanity. "Eat Me Up" is both literal and symbolic--to love her is to be devoured, to sacrifice themselves piece by piece until nothing is left to be devoured. The sharp beats and haunting vocals mirror the chaos of that realization: the pleasure of being consumed and the terror of being empty afterward.<br>
            <b>4. Chaconne</b> - This track takes its name from a baroque dance, historically associated with themes of passion and lament. In Dark Blood, it represents the endless waltz between the vampires and their fate. The melody is elegant yet heavy, like an eternal dance between desire and doom. In their lore's emotional timeline, this is the recollection--the part where they remember the first time they danced with her under the dying light, when everything still felt human. But as the music builds, it becomes clear that the dance is cursed to repeat forever. This song feels theatrical, echoing around tragedy. Through Chaconne, the boys realize that eternity without love is meaningless, but love in eternity is a curse that never ends.<br>
            <b>5. Bills</b> - This track pulls the grand tragedy back to reality. It is a song about the price of love--the emotional debts, the karmic cost of everything they've done. In the Dark Blood narrative, Bills reflects the guilt that comes after indulgence. After all the hunger and dancing around in blood, the dawn creeps in, and the bills come due; love, immortality, and fame: everything they took must be paid for. The lyrics echo the vampires' eternal punishment: to relive loss over and over. It's a haunting moment of reflection. In lore terms, this could the moment they lose her--when their choices catch up, when the blood bond snaps, and all that remains is emptiness. Bills is the consequence of "Bite Me".<br>
            <b>6. Karma</b> - If Fate began the story, then this track is like the outcome. It represents the eternal cycle they are trapped in. In Dark Blood, karma is not a punishment, it's inevitability. The same story repeats as they meet her. Musically and lyrically, "Karma" feels like an awakening in ashes. They understand that the darkness is not external anymore--it's inside them.<br>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><b>ORANGE BLOOD</b></td>
        <td>This album is the era where the vampiric curse, once so deeply rooted in darkness, begins to crack. In this era, the members confront whether they can reclaim humanity or at least a sliver of it. Whether the blood that binds them can become a bond of hope. In fan theories and trailer breakdowns, Orange Blood hints that the boys night be trying to return to human form, or rescue each other, or break the cycle. (One theory: "Orange Blood is about Enhypen coming back as humans.") Also, Weverese Magazine describes the shift: the vocals in this era are softer and more intimate, focusing more on addressing "you" (the listener / fans / the girl) than themselves. The narrative turns outward: from the vampires' interal struggles to their longing to reach someone else.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. Mortal</b> - In this track, the vampires remember what it was to die, to age, to be human. The track is their confession that part of them still aches for mortality ("Mortal"). In lore, Mortal is the moment they feel death's embrace again. It also suggests they might be on a path to becoming mortal again.<br>
            <b>2. Sweet Venom</b> - This is the title track and the heart of the era. The metaphor here is layered, venom is poison, yet "sweet" hints at temptation, beauty, the bittersweet. In trailer analyses, Sweet Venom is deeply connected to Dark Blood lore--it continued the blood cycle but tries to twist it. In the MV and concept visuals, we see themes of poison, serpentine imagery, and orange dusk. The vampires are tempted to bite, to heal, to kill, to be reborn. The song is their internal debate: drink, or be broken?<br>
            <b>3. Still Monster</b> - This track is their acceptance, that even if they try to be human, the monster inside still lingers. It's the moment of self-recognition. In the lore, after Mortal's hope, they try to move forward, but realize remission is not so simple. The monster inside of them remains in shadow.<br>
            <b>4. Blind</b> - This track is about losing sight, losing direction, and trusting love even when you can't see the future. In narrative, at this stage, the boys walk in twilight. They can't see clearly because their path to salvation is obscured.<br>
            <b>5. Orange Flower (You Complete Me)</b> - The phrase "You Complete Me" is direct and hopeful. This track is the possibility that "you" (the girl, the fans listening) is the complement they've craved for so long--the one who can complete the life they live. In the lore, this song may represent the moment when the vampire and human hearts converge. The boy says that although he is cursed, she completes him. Many fans interpret Orange Flower as the happy or hopeful ending of Orange Blood. However, trailers also hint that all is not settled. In Orange Blood's concept films, the girl is kidnapped, and echoes of darkness return.<br>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><b>MEMORABILIA</b></td>
        <td>This albums serves as a bridge between the musical lore and the Dark Moon (their manhwa/webtoon "Dark Moon: The Blood Altar") narrative. In the Dark Moon story, the seven members are vampire knights serving Decelis Academy, and their relationships, betrayals, and destinies are deeply entangled in a supernatural school lore. Thus, Memorabilia is the archive. It collects the emotional artifacts of their immortal journeys: the wounds that time can't heal and the voices that still haunt them. Together, each track forms the backstory that fills the gap betwee the high drama of Dark Blood/Orange blood, and the romance and desire arcs to come.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. One in a Billion</b> - This track acknowledges uniqueness and love against infinite odds. In lore, the boys claim that you are one in a billion among all eternity, and you are worth fighting for. This song affirms that among endless dark, there is one light that matters. In Dark Moon, the vampire knights have destinites, but perhaps the girl is a reincarnation, a sovereign, or a soul they remember. One in a billion ties to that idea, that she is singular.<br>
            <b>2. Criminal Love</b> - Love is taboo. This track frames love as a crime. Within the vampire society of Dark Moon, such love may be forbidden by rules, by fate, or by power structures. They boys feel guilt and fear in loving what they are told they shouldn't. Criminal Love internalizes the tension between duty and heart: are they sinning by love? Will their betrayal cost them everything?<br>
            <b>3. Fatal Trouble</b> - This track leans into the danger in their love. The combination of "fatal" and "trouble" suggests that their romance might be their undoing. In the webtoon, many conflicts center on betrayal, curses, and sacrificial acts. Fatal Trouble echoes the moment when love becomes tangled with existential risk.<br>
            <b>4. Teeth</b> - This track as the essential vampire imagery--blood, bite, power, and teeth. In Memorabilia, Teeth might function as the memory of first bites, first awakenings, and first transformations. It's also symbolic: the teeth are the tool of both bonding and betrayl; they leave marks.<br>
            <b>5. Lucifer</b> - This track evokes betrayal and fall. In lore, Lucifer can mean the fallen angel who rebelled, who tried to claim light but was cast out. In Memorabilia, Lucifer may parallel the boys' own rebellion against the curse or fate, their aspiration to rise out of darkness, and they price they pay for that pride.<br>
            <b>6. Scream</b> - Scream is the echo of their pain and supressed emotions. In the album's emotional arc, Scream is the release of sorrow, guilt, rage, and longing. As the last track, it suggests that memory is not quiet, and demands to be heard. So Memorabilia doesn't resolve everything, and instead reaffirms that their journey is haunted by what was, and that those ghosts will inform what comes next.<br>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><b>ROMANCE: UNTOLD and ROMANCE UNTOLD - DAYDREAM - :</b></td>
        <td>In Romance: Untold, the narrative turns to love as a force that might redeem or destroy. The boys face their deepest desire: to love freely. Here, "you" (girl/fan) become the axis of their world. The romance is untold, not because love is absent, but because it's forbidden. the repackage Romance: Untold - Daydream - gives a softer, dreamscape version. Dreams that might never manifest, but still live in their hearts. From concept cinema breakdowns, the romance concept intersects with Dark Moon lore.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. XO (Only If You Say Yes)</b> - This track is the confession point. "Only if you say yes", the boys await for permission as it's the girl's choice. In lore, the boys are supernatural, they do not demand, and instead wait for her consent. Their love becomes more human. In the concept cinema, XO is important as it sets the romantic foundation.<br>
            <b>2. Moonstruck</b> - This track evokes being mad with love and struck by lunar magic. In lore, moon phases matter (vampiric cycles, curse cycles). Moonstruck is love made lunatic by lunar influence. The curse intensifies under the moon, and under it, they fall again and again for her.<br>
            <b>3. Your Eyes Only</b> - This track suggests intimacy and exclusivity. In the crowded darkness, her eyes are the only guiding light. In the narrative, among eternal night, her gaze is sanctuary, and is the anchor they cling to to remain human at heart. And when everything else is cursed, her eyes are the pure connection.<br>
            <b>4. Hundred Broken Heart</b> - This song reflects the cose: love is not pointless. A hundred broken hearts means they know heartbreak, betrayal, and suffering. They might be willing to risk theirs for hers. In lore, the curse is tied to heartbreak.<br>
            <b>5. Brought the Heat Back</b> - After pain, this song is like their revival. In lore, love brings warmth back into the night. It's the moment when desire reignites and when hope returns. They risk burning, but they choose to feel again. Some fans also interpret this track suggesting jealousy, based on the lyrics.<br>
            <b>6. Paranormal</b> - This track evokes the supernatural intersecting with love The boys are creatures of uncanny, and love is now a paranormal phenomenon. This track may address how their love breaks the natural order. Love becomes otherworldly, and they must navigate that strangeness. In narrative, their romance is paranormal because it defies mortal boundaries.<br>
            <b>7. Royalty</b> - This suggests ther her role is greater than the mortal lover. In Dark Moon lore, there are kings, queens, and princes. that girl may be a priness or hold a throne in their fate. The boys see her as royalty, their love is service and devotion.<br>
            <b>8. Highway 1009</b> - This is an emotional track. The members composed this for Engenes (you). In lore, this can be their personal confession, breaking the fourth wall. The boys acknowledging that "you" are not just a narrative figure, but a real love, inspiration, and bond. In the lore, highway 1009 could represent the secret path they travel for love. A road they walk only because of their connection to Engenes/the girl. It reinforces that their struggle, curse, and sacrifice are not just for a fictional being, but for you--the real heart behind the myth.<br>
            <b>9. Daydream</b> - This is one of the tracks in the repackaged version of the album. This suggests a love meditation--what if they could exist without the curse's constraints, what if she never said yes, what if they could just be together without the pain? It'sall about hopes and fantasies.<br>
            <b>10. No Doubt</b> - This is the other track in the repackaged album. This talks about their promise--that by choosing love, they have no doubt. Even if fate whispers, they choose to trust and to love with no doubt.<br>

        <td><b>DESIRE: UNLEASH</b></td>
        <td>This album is the climax of their lore arc. If the last album was about confessions and tensions, this album is the breaking point. The moment when desire becomes an overt force. The teaser phrase "Can't touch you, but I'm gonna make you mine" (from their album announcement) hints about distance, longing, and boundaries, but an unstoppable push to close the gap. their desire is no longer subtle--it's unrestrained, borderless, dangerous, and essential. In lore, the boys no longer ask or wait, they push through the night, risking everything to bridge the last walls. their desire is both the weapon and the key.</td>
        <td>
            <b>1. Bad Desire (With or Without You)</b> - This is the title track. It suggests the darker side of love. It's lust, need, and obsession. In lore, when desire becomes bad, the boys acknowledge that love can wound them and her. Ths track is the admission that they are broke, but they still want her. They unleash this desire even while knowing the risk.<br>
            <b>2. Flashover</b> - This track suggests ignition and fire spreading. The spark turning into inferno. In the lore, Flashover is the moment when small longing bursts into uncontrollable fame. Desire overtakes reason and they cross lines.<br>
            <b>3. Outside</b> - If flashover is about leaping, then this track is about crossing. Outside the border of shadows, outside the cage, and outside the restraint. It's the movement into light or into danger. In the narrative, the barrier between them and "you" (the girl) fractures. So, they step outside what was forbidden.<br>
            <b>4. Loose</b> - This song suggests release, abandon, and unbinding. In lore, they cast off chains--emotional and supernatural. They loosen the curse, or at least resist it. They let go of control and surrender to desire.<br>
            <b>5. Helium</b> - This is the lightness and uplifting. In lore sense, helium is the fleeting moment of weightlessness in love. A respite from gravity, and darkness. Desire lifts them, even if temporarily, above the heavy curse.<br>
            <b>6. Too close</b> - Too close, and the curse may harm; too far, and their love is lost. They balance on that edge. In narrative, this track may represent the final push, or the final test--can love survive when they are too close to darkness<br>
